# Car Wash
demo here:
atvars.github.io/car-wash/.


This website is about hand car wash. This website shows for clients that they can trust them, they will always recieve high standart job. Clients can find all the options about car care plans what they can get. They see in details what they get in each plan and for what price. Also there is option to book full valet in particular date and time. All that is prooven by other custumers in testimonial section. 

## UX
 
From user side - what they expect simple inuvative website, where they can easy find all the information about car wash.

So I created website which is very simple and easy to navigate thru and understant what is what. There is two picture carousel with hand car washing pictures so client unserstands staright away he/she is in right place if they looking for hand car wash. 

On the next section as they scoll down basically they get all info what they need:
<li>When its open?</li> 
<li>How long its open?</li> 
<li>What you do for how much?</li>

As the big part main feature is that client can book full valet for his car from website, from his home.He dont need to get in car and drive all the way to car wash to find out when he can come. This will be why this car wash will atract more custumers - becouse we care about our custumers and their time and that is what we show in our web page.

Next section on web page you find very important part of that kind of bussines - testimonials. Here our custumers can make sure that they are in best place for their car. On this section they can gain this trust factor.

And last but not least is where and how to find us and our contact details.

Main goal was to create simple easy understandable intuitive website which I think I manage to do. For that I showed site to few of my friends and they said its very understandable and easy to navigate thru the site. Was happy with the answer.

Checked web site thru html validator https://validator.w3.org/ Had few bugs most of them was same mistake i created div as a ul child. so fixed that. Nothing major that made me happy. 

Checked CSS code https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
Shows lot of warning about my two color bacground.
And shows one eror wth Bootstrap cdn. Spent like hours to this bug couldnt figure it out. 

Checked my JS code http://beautifytools.com/javascript-validator.php
Checked all my JS code had no issues what so ever.

On console in dev tools shows no errors.

Tried my website in diferent web browsers all worked very good.
